# font-zoom
How about letting the user chose the font-size? 

While the browser zooming can have an unexpected behavior, a controlled  font increase/decrease  makes the appearance predictable and thus the designers' concepts are kept intact. 

In this JavaScript snippet code the default font size is set to 1em. When the user clicks on the buttons the font size  is increased or decreased by .1em

2 function are used to change the font size of the web page at client side.
_font_up(), 
_font_down()

The _font_size variable value will be changed whenever user clicks on the appropriate  button, the change falls upon div _main, who's  font size is changing by changing the fontSize attribute. ( _main.style.fontSize)
